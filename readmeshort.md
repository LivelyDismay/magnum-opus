You've used Wabbajack before? You know how it works?

Cool. Let's do this.

Make sure your Fallout 4 installation is clean. Disable the HD DLC. It sucks shit and it'll break everything.  

Open Wabbajack. Download Magnum Opus from the gallery.

Set the installation and download locations to blank folders. Shared downloads folders are fine if you have multiple lists installed. Don't use Windows protected folders like Desktop, Documents, Users, or Program Files.

Click the Play button.

Wait.

Did Wabbajack turn red and say `Installation Failed`? [Might be because of this.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/wabbajack-stuff/Opus-Readme-Long.md#problems-with-wabbajack)

Did Wabbajack turn green and say `Installation Complete`? Nice, let's go.

Open your installation folder. There's a folder there called `Game Folder Files`. Open that up.

Copy everything inside `Game Folder Files.`

Paste those files into your Fallout 4 folder (`steamapps\common\Fallout 4`).

Go back to your installation folder.

Launch `ModOrganizer.exe`.

Does it say `F4SE` in the right hand side, next to that big RUN button? Yeah? Good. Click that big RUN button then.

Make your character. Select whatever options you want, it doesn't matter. Wake up in the vault.

Press Escape. Select `Mod Config`, then `MCM Settings Manager`.

See that preset at the bottom, the `Magnum Opus MCM Settings` one? Click Apply.

Tab back out to the game.
