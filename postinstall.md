### BiRaitBec Texture Optimization

This step hashes your vanilla files, just like Wabbajack hashes all the downloads and mods. They need to be PERFECTLY CLEAN AND UNALTERED. If you'd like to be sure, just Verify Integrity of Game Files through Steam to make sure your Fallout 4 archives are pristine.

Go to [BiRaitBec Workbase Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57782) and download the Main File.  
Extract this archive into a blank folder, outside of a Windows protected directory (such as `D:/Workbase Improved`).  

Download the following files:

* [2a. Main Repack - Part One-23556-1-0-1565616028.7z](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=files&file_id=164245)
* [2b. Main Repack - Part Two-23556-1-0-1565980979.7z](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=files&file_id=164487)
* [2c. Main Reapack - Part Three-23556-1-0-1565605113.7z](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=files&file_id=164241)
* [Fix Vault-Window-Metal-Institute-40534-1-02-1565670781.7z](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40534?tab=files&file_id=164279)
* [3. Restyle Pack - Fomod-23556-1-0-1565546849.7z](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=files&file_id=164211)

**COPY** the `2a. Main Repack - Part One`, `2b. Main Repack - Part Two`, `2c. Main Reapack - Part Three`, `Fix Vault-Window-Metal-Institute`, and `3. Restyle Pack - Fomod` archives into the `D:/Workbase Improved/Repack7z` folder. **DO NOT EXTRACT, UNPACK, OR RENAME ANY OF THESE FILES.**

Now go back to your `Workbase Improved` folder again. Double click the `Installer.cmd` file to run it.  
- If the file opens up in Notepad instead of running, simply close it and instead right click on the file and choose `Open`.

Choose the output of your liking. You may use the default `PatchedBa2` folder, or navigate to your Magnum Opus installation and select `mods/[NoDelete] Workbase Optimized Textures` (recommended).  

PowerShell will now launch and begin verifying all of your archives, then repacking your .ba2 files.  
**This process may take an hour or two, depending on your hardware. For most people, it takes about fifteen minutes.**

When the installer is finished, it will automatically close itself.
- If you chose the default `PatchedBa2` folder for your output, navigate to that folder, select all the archives inside, Copy them (right `click > copy`, or `Ctrl+C`). Then navigate to `Magnum Opus/mods/[NoDelete] Workbase Optimized Textures` and paste the archives here (`right click > paste`, or `Ctrl+V`).

Due to how Wabbajack works, you only need to do this step ONCE. The `[NoDelete]` flag will prevent Wabbajack from ever deleting this mod during updates, so you will never have to redo this step unless you delete it yourself. Huzzah!

*Many thanks to Rux616 for the Workbase Improved installer, please do go show him some love and endorse his work.*

If you're still using the old Workbase Improved output, that's totally fine! Your perk chart will look different than mine does in the Youtube videos (as that's from the Restyle pack), but it's still perfectly functional. Dealer's choice!

### Performance Tweaks

Launch ModOrganizer.exe from inside your installation folder (the one you chose for the modlist when you first installed it via the Wabbajack app). There's a big bar on the right side that says `F4SE`. Click this to reveal the dropdown menu and select `Fallout 4 Launcher`. Click `Run`. On the launcher, click `Options`. Under the `Detail` tab, click `Medium` or `High`. Do not click `Ultra`. I don't care how good your computer is; this game is old and doesn't care about your hardware. I would also recommend checking the `Windowed Mode` and `Borderless` boxes. When finished, press `OK`. You may now Exit the launcher.

### Launching the Game

Back in MO2, change the dropdown back to `F4SE`. This is how you will launch the game from now on. **You need to launch the game in this exact way every time in order to play with the installed mods.**

### A Few Quick Notes

- Papa Lively has a lot of cats. [Your support would be immensely appreciated.](https://www.patreon.com/c/nicholasjae)
- It is recommended that you leave Vault 111 prior to reporting any issues to me. Please.
- Sometimes the game can scale in odd ways. Please [read the FAQ](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/magnum-opus/blob/main/faq.md#when-i-start-magnum-opus-the-game-is-zoomed-in) to resolve this issue, and to help with any other frequently asked questions about the modlist.
- Your Pipboy flashlight will not work between the time you pick it up and the time you press the button to open the vault door. It genuinely amazes me how many people report this to me. Just press the button, it's right there.
- On rare occasions, True Damage won't load properly straight away. This will be apparently if your 10mm pistol does 1 damage, and the radroaches in Vault 111 take a dozen shots to kill. To fix this, simply save and load the game (you may need to exit the game fully). I'd recommend enabling the option to kill all Vault 111 radroaches, so you can check your damage in your Pipboy at the end of the vault.
